Much of this information is captured within web archives (WARC) created by organizations such as the Internet Archive, the BnF, and The British Library1. By collaborating with these institutions, scholars from the digital humanities can use web archives to study human production. For instance:\nTo study Latin American Women’s Rights Movements through Language, Time and Space. For comparing the way countries conduct online political campaigns. To analyze the public opinion on social media platforms (e.g., #metoo). Due to the massive volume and the variety of information available on web archives (e.g., webpages, PDFs, images, videos, audio), manually exploring web archives is a complex and time-consuming task. In this context, data science and Big Data technologies offer an opportunity to extract value from large collections of WARCs files like Common Crawl.\nObjective Through this datathon, participants will :\nDevelop awareness about new analytical requirements resulting from the datafication phenomena that call for data science expertise.\nPut into practice participants’ Big Data technical skills to analyse and explore web archives produced in the context of the LINFRANUM (Cartographie de la Littérature Française Numérique) project.\nDevelop storytelling skills to explain analytical pipelines to technical and non-technical experts.\nThe datathon will heavily use of Apache Spark and the Archives Unleashed Toolkit, a project that makes petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the digital recent past.\nLearning Outcomes Regarding Spark you will be able to:\nPrepare a Spark environment in an externalised computing environment and schematically explain the underlying functional architecture. Transfrom unstructured data collections into tabular representation (i.e. make sure that you can explain the necessity of this transformation and its benefits related to the use of Spark) Design and explain a data exploration pipeline using Spark operators. Regarding data storytelling, you will be able to:\nImport visualization tools into your notebook. Produce code to feed visualization functions. Provide insight (textual) to describe input data and interpret data processing results. Understand the architecture behind your notebook with the storage services, Spark data processing and the visualization tool(s). https://archivesunleashed.org/cohorts2022-2023/ ↩︎\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f45aac8cb33a49e0baed8787f5436744","permalink":"https://espinosa-oviedo.com/big-data-analytics/events/datathon/description/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/big-data-analytics/events/datathon/description/","section":"events","summary":"Motivation The amount of cultural information that is generated every day on the Web presents new opportunities for historians, political scientists, sociologists, linguists, computer scientists, and other scholars.

Explore the WARC files following a data science approach (i.e., hypothesis definition and validation). Present your findings to a jury and peers during a demofest. The following sections describe each of these phases in detail.\nPhase 1: Data Profiling The objective of this phase is to help you get acquainted with the data (i.e., understand data structure, numerical values distribution, identifying outliers and null values).\nExample:\nCount all media types contained in a WARC file (e.g., images, webpages, videos). Plot the distribution of media types and their storage space usage. The list of statistics to compute is in the Queries section.\nNote: For phase 1, the usage of Apache Spark is mandatory.\nPhase 2: Data Exploration Once you have a basic understanding of your dataset’s content, you can do a more in deep analysis following the scientific principle:\nFormulate a hypothesis or research question according to the insight you obtained in the previous task.\nValidate it using analytics techniques (e.g., natural language processing, machine learning, data mining, graph analytics).\nExample\nHypothesis: Writers prefer public blog platforms (e.g., Blogger, WordPress) rather than creating/installing their websites from scratch.\nValidation: Web pages can contain a meta tag describing the technology used for producing the web page. For instance:\n\u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;generator\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;WordPress 3.0.1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; By counting the frequency of occurrences of this metatag in the dataset, it is possible to identify the most popular platforms used in the litterature community.\nNote: For phase 2, the usage of Apache Spark is optional\nPhase 3: Demofest The final phase consists of preparing a presentation and a poster to report your findings during the demofest.\nThe presentation and poster must answer the following questions:\nWhat data do you work with (which data collection, its volume MB, etc.)? How did you divide the work among team members? What hypothesis did you propose? Why? What type of Spark operations did you apply (Did they work? Did they provide expected results?) What is the architecture of the infraestructure that you used? How the components and libraries interact with your Notebook(s)? Conclusions (go back to the learning outcomes and discuss which ones could be achieved or not through the exercise) The presentation and poster should be complemented with a “demo” (e.g., using a notebook, a visualization tool or a video) showing your findings and the technical aspects involving your analysis.\nFor this phase, you can use the Archives Unleashed New York Datathon projects as reference.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"18601e64700bb757d51d80358dbcf02d","permalink":"https://espinosa-oviedo.com/big-data-analytics/events/datathon/instructions/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/big-data-analytics/events/datathon/instructions/","section":"events","summary":"Given a collection of WARC files (and working in teams), you will have to:\nProfile the content of the WARC files using a quantitative approach.
