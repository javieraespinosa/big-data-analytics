The amount of cultural information that is generated every day in the Web presents new opportunities for historians, political scientists, sociologists, linguists, computer scientists, and other scholars. Much of this information is captured within **web archives** ([WARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive)) created by organizations such as the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org), the [BnF](https://www.bnf.fr/fr/archives-de-linternet), and [The British Library](https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/uk-web-archive)[^1]. In collaboration with these institutions, scholars from the [digital humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) use today web archives to study the human production. For instance, to:

* Study Latin American Womenâ€™s Rights Movements through Language, Time and Space.
* Compare the way countries conduct online political campaigns
* Analyze the public opinion in social media platforms (e.g., #metoo)

Due to the massive **volume** and the **variety** of information available on web archives (e.g., webpages, PDFs, images, videos, audio), manually exploring web archives is a complex and time-consuming task. In this context, data science and Big Data technologies offer an opportunity to extract **value** from large collections of WARCs files like [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/).
